                    <p>
                    <p>In Sri Lanka, property tenure refers to the legal ownership and rights associated with land.
                        There are two
                        primary types of property tenure:</p>

                    <span class="span2">1. Freehold: </span> <br>

                    <p>This is the outright ownership of land or property, providing the owner with full rights to use,
                        sell, or
                        transfer the property as they wish, subject to local laws.</p>

                    <span class="span2"> 2. Leasehold: </span>


                    <p>This is a temporary form of ownership where the government or a private individual grants rights
                        to use the
                        land or property for a specified period under an agreed lease. The terms of the lease, including
                        its
                        duration and conditions, can vary depending on the intended use of the property and the
                        agreement between
                        the parties.</p>

                    <p> While homeownership comes with significant responsibilities and costs, many find that the

                    <p>In Sri Lanka, the property tax system involves several key components
